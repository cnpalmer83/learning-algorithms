Simple algorithms written in Java.  None of the code is meant to maximize efficiency or solve real world problems!  This code is meant to clearly illustrate the logic behind the common algorithms for quick reference.  Each algorithm is contained in its own package within the 'algo' package.  Run the corresponding 'App.java' file to execute them.  

Algorithms were made in conjunction with the Udemy course found here:
